# Workout_Tracker
This is a web-based app that helps a user create workout plans, track their progress, and view graphical summary data to help understand their progress.

## User Story
```
As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
```
